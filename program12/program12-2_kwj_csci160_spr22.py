Assignment:

.. note::
    Function HEADERS are written exactly as specified per assignment
    instructions, i.e., written in camelCase with whitespace between the
    function's name and its parameters. camelCase persists for
    declaration of variables for consistency. When a function is called,
    the absence of whitespace between a function's name and its
    arguments was judged to have no effect on performance; thus, such
    whitespace is excluded outside of function headers.

Functions:

"""


def main():
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
