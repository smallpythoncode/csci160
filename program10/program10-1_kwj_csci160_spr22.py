Copyright (C) 2022 Kenneth Jahnke

Prompt the user for a series of class names and the number of credits
for each class. The class name must be in "DEPT NUM" format, for
example, "CSCI 160". Assign every valid entry to a dictionary with the
class as a string and the number of credits as an integer. Continue to
ask for classes until the user enters a blank value.

Prompt the user for a file name. Write the key-value pairs to the file
with one pair per line and a tab character ("\t") between the key and
value.
